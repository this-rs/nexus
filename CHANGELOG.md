# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

> [!WARNING]
> **This file stops at 0.1.10 (2025-01-15); the workspace is at 0.5.0.** Checked
> 2026-10-01.
>
> Four minor versions shipped without an entry here. Do not read the absence of a
> `0.5.0` section as "nothing changed" — read it as "this file was not updated".
> `git log` is the record for that span.
>
> **Why it was not regenerated.** `cliff.toml` is configured but has never been run: the
> header above is not the one it emits, and its footer is absent. It also cannot be run
> usefully as things stand — git-cliff groups commits by tag, and the newest version tag in
> this repository is `v0.0.5`, so the 126 commits since would collapse into a single
> `[Unreleased]` block. Creating the missing tags is a release action, deliberately not
> taken here.
>
> **To close the gap:** tag the releases that shipped, then
> `git-cliff --output CHANGELOG.md`, then delete this notice —
> `cargo test -p claude-code-api --test docs_changelog` fails if the notice outlives the
> gap, and fails while the gap outlives the notice.

## [0.1.5] - 2025-01-23

### Integrations
- **url-preview v0.6.0** - First external project to integrate claude-code-api for LLM-powered web content extraction

### Major Changes
- **Restructured as Workspace**: Reorganized project into a Cargo workspace with two crates:
  - `claude-code-api` - The OpenAI-compatible REST API server
  - `claude-code-sdk-rs` - The underlying Rust SDK for Claude Code CLI integration
- **Built on claude-code-sdk-rs**: The API server now uses the robust SDK internally for all Claude interactions

### Added
- **Performance Optimizations via SDK**:
  - Connection pooling with `OptimizedClient` for 5-10x faster responses
  - Multiple client modes: OneShot, Interactive, and Batch processing
  - Pre-warming of connection pools for reduced first-request latency
  - Batch processing endpoints for high-throughput scenarios
- **Enhanced OpenAI Compatibility**:
  - Better conversation history handling in chat completions
  - Proper token counting in responses
  - Streaming response improvements
- **New Examples and Testing Tools**:
  - Manual interactive test tools for both SDK and OpenAI API modes
  - OpenAI-compatible server with proper history support
  - Comprehensive testing scripts for all modes
  - Performance benchmarking examples
- **Tool Calling Support**:
  - Full OpenAI tools format compatibility (removed deprecated functions format)
  - Automatic detection and formatting of tool calls in Claude's responses
  - Returns proper `tool_calls` array format
  - Seamless integration with modern AI tools like url-preview
- **Extended Timeout Support**:
  - Configurable timeout via CLAUDE_CODE__CLAUDE__TIMEOUT_SECONDS
  - Default timeout increased to 600 seconds for long-running tasks
  - Proper session cleanup on timeout to prevent EPIPE errors

### Changed
- **Architecture**: API server now leverages `cc-sdk` for all Claude operations
- **Performance**: Default configuration now uses optimized clients with connection pooling
- **Documentation**: Updated to reflect the workspace structure and SDK integration

### Fixed
- OpenAI chat completions now properly handle full conversation history
- Token counting now accurately reflects the entire conversation context
- Improved error handling and recovery in connection pool management
- Fixed timeout errors for long-running tasks (WebSearch, etc.)
- Fixed EPIPE errors by properly closing sessions on timeout
- Resolved all compilation warnings

## [claude-code-sdk-rs 0.1.5] - 2025-01-22

### Fixed
- Fixed interactive mode hang issue in Rust SDK with new SimpleInteractiveClient implementation
- Resolved deadlock in ClaudeSDKClient where receiver task held transport lock preventing sends
- Fixed transport layer to support multiple message receivers using broadcast channels

### Added
- New SimpleInteractiveClient that works correctly for stateful conversations
- Broadcast channel implementation in transport layer for multiple receivers
- Working examples and tests for interactive mode

### Changed

- Modified receive_messages() to create new receivers instead of taking ownership

## [0.1.4] - 2025-01-22

### Fixed
- Fixed critical issue where default `use_interactive_sessions` was set to true, causing timeouts
- Fixed interactive session mode issues with Claude CLI
- Resolved compilation errors with Handler trait bounds
- Fixed timeout issues with process pool mode
- Improved error handling for Claude process communication

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Changed default `use_interactive_sessions` from true to false
- Temporarily disabled interactive session mode due to Claude CLI limitations
- Using process pool mode by default for better stability
- Improved logging for debugging process communication

### Added

- Better error messages for timeout scenarios

## [0.1.3] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- Fixed default log level to ensure consistent logging output for both command aliases
- Changed default log filter from module-specific to global "info" level

## [0.1.2] - 2025-01-21

### Added
- Added `ccapi` as a shorter command alias for `claude-code-api`
- Both `claude-code-api` and `ccapi` commands are now available after installation

## [0.1.1] - 2025-01-21

### Fixed
- Fixed critical issue where Claude CLI was interpreting prompts as file paths
- Changed stdin handling from `Stdio::null()` to `Stdio::piped()` to properly send input to Claude
- Messages are now correctly sent via stdin instead of command line arguments

### Changed
- Improved error handling for stdin write operations

## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-21

### Initial Release
- High-performance OpenAI-compatible API gateway for Claude Code CLI
- Process pooling for improved efficiency
- Response caching with SHA256
- Multimodal support (text and images)
- MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
- Streaming responses via SSE
- Session management
- File access control
- Comprehensive error handling with retries
## 0.2.0 - 2025-10-07

Highlights
- Transport trait extended with default `end_input()`; `SubprocessTransport` closes stdin to signal end-of-input.
- Control protocol parity with Python Agent SDK:
  - `Query::set_model(Some|None)` and `Query::set_permission_mode(..)`
  - snake_case/camelCase field compatibility for `can_use_tool` and `hook_callback`
  - Query startup forwards non-control SDK messages from transport
- CLI argument passthrough:
  - `include_partial_messages` → `--include-partial-messages`
  - `fork_session` → `--fork-session`
  - `setting_sources` → `--setting-sources user,project,local`
  - `agents` → `--agents <json>`
- Diagnostics: sets `CLAUDE_AGENT_SDK_VERSION` env with crate version.

Notes
- Minor version bump due to trait extension; `end_input()` has a default no-op impl.
- Consider switching to Auto/Control protocol formats once the CLI stabilizes.
